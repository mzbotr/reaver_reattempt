reaver_reattempt
================

This script is used to change the Mac address of the wifi connection as well as the emulated one created by airmon-ng in an attempt to avoid being locked out of routers for repeated WPS attack attempts. The reaver command runs once and then the script gives the machine a new Mac address.
